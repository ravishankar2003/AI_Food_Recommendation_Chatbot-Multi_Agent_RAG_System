# AI Food Recommendation Chatbot: Multi-Agent RAG System

## **Project Overview**

The **AI Food Recommendation Chatbot** is a sophisticated multi-agent system aimed at providing **personalized, context-aware food recommendations** through natural conversation. Built upon a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm, the system leverages advanced user modeling, conversational memory, semantic retrieval, and explainable reranking to optimize food suggestions for individual users. Its modular agents, robust data engineering, and user clustering ensure relevance, scalability, and adaptability for varying user behaviors and food contexts.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **User Input:**  
   - Users engage the chatbot with food-related queries or preferences (e.g., “Show me spicy veg biryani under 300”).

2. **Conversational Agent:**  
   - **Intent Classification:** Determines the itent of the user like greeting, goodbye, preference updation, request for recommendation, specifying preference etc.
   - **Slot Extraction:** Extracts structured information from the conversation (dietary, cuisine, dish, price, etc.).
   - **Memory Updation:** Updates session memory to retain preferences and context.

3. **Sufficiency Check:**  
   - Decides if enough info is available to generate recommendations.
   - If not, the agent asks targeted follow-up questions.

4. **Retrieval Agent:**  
   - **Query Enhancer:** Transforms structured slots into robust search queries and filters.
   - **Retrieval from Shards:** Performs semantic searches over sharded databases of food items.

5. **Reranking Agent:**  
   - **Condition Generation & Evaluation:** Produces context-sensitive, explainable ranking rules based on the user’s food journey and menu diversity.
   - **Evaluator & Top 10 Identifier:** Scores and explains top 10 results, ensuring the best fit and diversity.

6. **Output:**  
   - Presents recommendations or further clarifying questions to the user, looping until satisfaction.

## **Solution Architecture**

### 1. **Conversational Agent**
- **File:** `conversation_agent.py`
  - **Intent Classification:** Uses LLMs and fallback pattern recognition (`intent_classifier.py`) to detect user goals.
  - **Slot Extraction:** Employs prompt-based extraction plus robust rules (`slot_extract.py`, `query_enhancer.py`).
  - **Memory Management:** Maintains stateful conversation context (`memory.py`).
  - **Output:** A set of structured preferences and clear user intent, enabling smooth pipeline orchestration.

### 2. **Recommendation Sufficiency Check**
- **Embedded Logic:** In `conversation_agent.py`, checks for essential details (like dietary and price).
- **Diagram Mapping:** The central diamond; if information is incomplete, prompts the user; otherwise, triggers retrieval and reranking.

### 3. **Retrieval Agent**
- **Files:** `shards_retrieval.py`, (functions also exposed via `orchestrator.py`)
  - **Query Refinement:** Structures and optimizes semantic queries using `query_enhancer.py`.
  - **Sharded Retrieval:** Searches distributed ChromaDB shards via dense embeddings (`embeddings.py`), ensuring speed and scalability.

### 4. **Re-ranking Agent**
- **Files:** `rerank.py`, `rerank_prompts.py`
  - **Contextual Reranking:** Analyzes user journey, applies dynamic, explainable ranking/validation for top recommendations.
  - **Explainability:** Outputs condition reasoning and QA, making the selection process transparent and defensible.

### 5. **Embeddings & Shard Creation**
- **Files:** `embeddings.py`, `shards_creation.ipynb`
  - **Embeddings:** Utilizes sentence-transformers to vectorize each food/menu item for semantic similarity.
  - **Sharding:** Splits large databases into efficient “shards” for fast, parallel retrieval.

### 6. **User Clustering & Data Pre-processing**
- **Files:** `user_clustering_agent.py`, `User_Clustering_agent.ipynb`, `derived_feature_engineering.ipynb`, `2-cuisines.ipynb`, `zomato_restaurant_data_cleaning.ipynb`
  - **Clustering:** Segments users by behavior (demographics, purchases, cuisine affinity) using KMeans, making suggestions more relevant.
  - **Preprocessing:** Cleans, normalizes, engineers features (e.g., veg ratio, price tiers), supporting robust recommendation logic and clustering.

## **How the Components Work Together**

- Conversations flow through the **Conversational Agent**, which extracts intent, slots, and maintains memory for multi-turn dialogues.
- Once enough preferences are gathered, the **Retrieval Agent** turns these into optimized, context-rich search queries.
- These queries search a semantic **vector DB** distributed in **shards** (for efficiency)—returning a candidate set of food items.
- The **Re-ranking Agent** processes retrieved items, using the user’s session context, journey, and explainable conditions to select the most fitting top 10.
- **User Clustering** and **engineered data features** guide personalization ensuring user traits, habits, and history are considered.
